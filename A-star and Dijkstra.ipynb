    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code implements and compares two popular shortest-path algorithms, **A**\\* (A-Star) and **Dijkstra**. These algorithms are evaluated based on runtime, number of nodes visited, and path length. The analysis is conducted using OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for a road network between the **Golden Gate Bridge** üåâ in San Francisco, CA, and **Etcheverry Hall** üêª in UC Berkeley, CA. The algorithms are visualized using Folium maps to show both explored nodes and optimal paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Description of Algorithms**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **A\\* Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "The A\\* algorithm is a graph traversal and path search technique that efficiently finds the shortest path by combining the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm and heuristic estimation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cost Function**: The algorithm minimizes , where:\n",
    "  - Actual cost from the start node to the current node .\n",
    "  - Heuristic estimate of the cost from the current node  to the goal.\n",
    "- **Heuristic**: The code uses the **Haversine formula** to calculate the great-circle distance between two geographical points. This provides an admissible and consistent heuristic for road networks.\n",
    "- **Priority Queue**: The nodes are prioritized using their total cost , enabling exploration of promising nodes first.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Haversine Formula**\n",
    "The Haversine formula is used in pathfinding to calculate the great-circle distance between two points on Earth, accounting for its curvature. It is accurate, computationally efficient, and widely applicable in navigation, logistics, and location-based services.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a = \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\phi}{2}\\right) + \\cos(\\phi_1) \\cdot \\cos(\\phi_2) \\cdot \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{2}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c = 2 \\cdot \\arctan2\\left(\\sqrt{a}, \\sqrt{1-a}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "d = R \\cdot c\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables:\n",
    "- ‚≤´: Latitudes (in radians)\n",
    "- Œª: Longitudes (in radians)\n",
    "- R = 6,371 km: Earth's radius\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nodes are tracked using a `heapq` priority queue.\n",
    "- Explored nodes and their parents are stored in a dictionary to reconstruct the path.\n",
    "- The algorithm terminates once the goal node is reached, returning the optimal path.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Dijkstra's Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dijkstra's algorithm is a classic shortest-path algorithm that explores nodes in order of increasing distance from the start node:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It considers only the **actual cost**  from the start node.\n",
    "- Unlike A\\*, Dijkstra does not use any heuristic function.\n",
    "- It guarantees the shortest path by exploring all nodes with the smallest cumulative cost first.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- NetworkX's `single_source_dijkstra_path_length` computes the path lengths and tracks visited nodes.\n",
    "- The optimal path is retrieved using `shortest_path` with the edge weight parameter set to `length`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Heuristics and Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph Representation**: The road network is represented as a directed graph using OSMnx, where:\n",
    "   - Nodes represent intersections or points of interest.\n",
    "   - Edges represent road segments with weights corresponding to their length.\n",
    "2. **Haversine Distance**: This heuristic is applied in the A\\* algorithm to estimate the distance between nodes, which is critical for speeding up the search by guiding it towards the goal.\n",
    "3. **Path Tracking**: A custom `PathTracker` class is used to monitor all visited nodes during execution. This enables comparison of explored nodes between A\\* and Dijkstra.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Experimental Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithms were executed on the road network graph to find the shortest distance between Golden Gate Bridge and Etchverry Hall. Key metrics such as runtime, number of nodes visited, and path length were compared. The results are summarized in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Algorithm    | Runtime (s) | Visited Nodes | Path Length (nodes) |\n",
    "| ------------ | ----------- | ------------- | ------------------- |\n",
    "| **A**\\*      |   0.007976  |      507      |         171         |\n",
    "| **Dijkstra** |   0.425721  |     30,015     |         177         |\n"

    "#### **Observations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A**\\* performs better than Dijkstra in terms of runtime due to its heuristic-driven approach, which reduces the number of nodes visited.\n",
    "- **A**\\* returns the shorter path length, confirming the optimality of A\\*.\n",
    "- Dijkstra explores significantly more nodes because it lacks a heuristic, leading to more exhaustive traversal of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Visualization Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **A**\\*:\n",
    "   - The yellow paths are more focused and directional towards the goal due to the Haversine heuristic.\n",
    "   - This targeted exploration reduces the computational overhead.\n",
    "2. **Dijkstra**:\n",
    "   - The yellow paths are more widespread, indicating a less targeted approach.\n",
    "   - Dijkstra explores all possible paths until the goal is reached, increasing the number of visited nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison between A\\* and Dijkstra highlights the efficiency of heuristic-driven search methods for pathfinding:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A**\\* is faster and visits fewer nodes, making it more suitable for large-scale networks.\n",
    "- **Dijkstra**, while guaranteed to find the optimal path, incurs higher computational costs due to its exhaustive nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging the Haversine distance as a heuristic, A* effectively reduces unnecessary exploration and accelerates the search process, making it an ideal choice for real-world road networks which is used in Google Maps and has enormous applications in logistics."
